# Possible code solution for building scenario 1

'''
The building energy usage is acting unusual â€“ it is much lower than normal for this time period and does not appear to be changing much.  
Is there a data issue with the meter where it may be frozen or not reporting accurate data?  
What happens if the meter is under reporting the actual usage of the building for a period?
